## Core Strategy
Lean PRD — outcomes, users, use cases, non-functionals, guardrails, metrics.
MVP Scope & Release Plan — v0/v1/v2 cuts, feature flags, “won’t haves.”
Experiment Plan — hypotheses, test design, power, decision rules.
Analytics Spec (Event Taxonomy) — events, props, IDs, governance.

## Product Definition
Tech Spec — system context, sequence diagrams, key algorithms, tradeoffs.
API Contracts — request/response, error model, versioning.
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — one page per irreversible choice.
Security & Privacy Pack — data flow, retention, DPIA/PIA, threat model.
SLOs & Observability — golden signals, alerts, runbooks.

## Engineering & data
Roadmap & RACI — who decides/builds/reviews.
RAID Log — risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies.
Launch Checklist & GTM Brief — readiness gates, comms, support.
