# Core strategy & discovery (why/for whom)

* For any adult over 18 that has a house, car, valuables that they need to insure and are looking to renew their insurance
* [hypothesis] Current insurance renewal process is broken - it's manual, time consuming and opaque
* [hypothesis] Most customers are not satisfied with how much they are paying for their insurance
 * [hypothesis .1] Most customers do not understand the subcomponents to their insurance and how they apply to their situations
 * [hypothesis .2] Prices for insurance are opaque, shopping process is so cumbersome that most people give-up after their first few data points
  * Most customers feel they are overpaying for their insurance, there is a mesh of companies and their agents, each entity has a unique way of receiving information - either through forms OR phone / email
* 


# Product definition (what)

* Take the existing insurance coverage, understand the current coverage and price point


# Engineering & data (how)

* Breakdown coverage by the different components - like home, auto etc
  * Understand the subcomponents selected in the insurance - e.g. is there flood insurance, is there earthquake insurance etc
*
